# PyTorch Essentials: A Beginner's Journey üöÄ

This repository documents my journey of learning PyTorch through the fantastic free course offered by freeCodeCamp on YouTube. It's a collection of my notes, code, and projects as I've worked my way through the fundamentals of this powerful deep learning library.

## About this Repository

This repository is a personal learning project. The primary goal is to solidify my understanding of PyTorch by applying the concepts taught in the course. It's not meant to be a collection of state-of-the-art models but rather a transparent and honest documentation of a beginner's learning process.

I've organized the repository to mirror the topics covered in the course. You'll find my implementations of various concepts, from the very basics to more complex topics like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## The Journey üó∫Ô∏è

My experience with this course has been incredibly rewarding. I started with a basic understanding of Python and a keen interest in machine learning, and this course has provided a structured and hands-on approach to learning PyTorch. The projects and exercises have been instrumental in helping me grasp the practical aspects of building and training neural networks.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

The repository is organized into the following directories:

* **/Basic:** Covers the fundamental concepts of PyTorch, such as tensors and basic operations.
* **/Regression:** Includes projects and code related to building linear regression models.
* **/Classification:** Contains implementations of classification models.
* **/CNN:** Explores the world of Convolutional Neural Networks for image-based tasks.

You'll also find `helper_functions.py` and `helper_functions_2.py`, which contain utility functions used across different projects.

## A Note on Performance üìù

As this is a learning repository, the models you'll find here are intentionally simple. The focus is on understanding the core concepts and the process of building and training models in PyTorch. Therefore, you might notice that the **accuracies and other performance metrics are not optimized**.

Here are a few reasons for this:

* **Entry-Level Models:** The models are designed to be simple and easy to understand. They often have a limited number of layers and neurons. A deeper or more complex model architecture would likely yield better results.
* **Data:** The datasets used are standard, educational datasets. For real-world applications, more extensive and diverse datasets would be necessary for better performance.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** I have not extensively tuned the hyperparameters of the models. Things like learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs could be optimized to improve performance.

The code itself is a faithful implementation of the concepts taught in the course and is functionally correct. The shortcomings in performance are a deliberate choice to keep the focus on learning the fundamentals.

## Future Improvements üí°

I plan to continue building on this repository as I learn more about PyTorch and deep learning. Some of the future improvements I have in mind are:

* Implementing more advanced architectures.
* Experimenting with different datasets.
* Diving deeper into hyperparameter tuning and optimization techniques.
* Exploring other areas of deep learning, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning.
